# Project_01_public_health_study
Carried out a large-scale study on the theme of undernutrition in the world.

The hunger problem is complex and can have multiple causes, which differ from country to country. Therefore, the preliminary stage of this study will be to establish a "state of the art" of the research already published and to carry out a statistical study intended to direct research towards particular countries and highlight various causes of hunger.
